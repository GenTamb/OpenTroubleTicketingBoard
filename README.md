# OpenTroubleTicketingBoard
An Open Trouble Ticketing Board!

Hello everybody!

I'm proud to show my new project: an open source Trouble Ticketing Board!

I'll use all my new acquired knowledges to write an ITIL like board to manage issues. 

I did not checked if something like this already exists..I'm pretty sure about that, 
but I need something to work on during my spare time :)

This time, the entire project will be in English.

For now, i've completed the setup step.

What the SETUP does?

1) Acquires data from user about MySQL hostname, user, password and a custom db name
2) generate the DB named by the user
3) create the db.php which will be used to connect to MySQL for future uses
4) acquires admin's info
5) generate the users table, adding the admin
6) acquires board's info 
7) generate the board table, adding the data just inserted

TO DO:
1) board's home
2) CRUD for users
3) CRUD for incidents
4) CRUD for tech's group
5) anything else
6) ...

Feel free to contact me for any doubts or critics: www.gennarotamburrelli.eu

The code, as always, is completely free. If you use it, just name me :)
And if I helped you to understand something, name me twice :P
